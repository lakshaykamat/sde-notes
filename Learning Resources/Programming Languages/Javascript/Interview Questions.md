## Basic JavaScript Interview Questions and Answers

### 1. What is JavaScript?

**Answer:**  
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted scripting language that is used to create and control dynamic website content, like interactive forms, animations, and other user interactions on web pages. It is a core technology of the web, alongside HTML and CSS.

### 2. What are variables in JavaScript? How do you declare them?

**Answer:**  
Variables are containers for storing data values. In JavaScript, you can declare variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`.

```javascript
var name = 'John';  // function-scoped
let age = 30;       // block-scoped
const city = 'New York'; // block-scoped and read-only
```

### 3. What are JavaScript operators?

**Answer:**  
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. JavaScript supports various types of operators including:

- Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- Comparison (`==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `>`, `<`)
- Logical (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
- Assignment (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.)

### 4. What are functions in JavaScript?

**Answer:**  
Functions are blocks of code designed to perform a particular task. They are executed when they are called (invoked).

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return 'Hello, ' + name;
}
console.log(greet('Alice')); // Hello, Alice
```

### 5. What are arrays in JavaScript?

**Answer:**  
Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. They are a special type of object in JavaScript.

```javascript
let fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry'];
console.log(fruits[0]); // Apple
```

### 6. What is an object in JavaScript?

**Answer:**  
Objects are collections of properties, where each property is defined as a key-value pair. They are used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities.

```javascript
let person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  city: 'New York'
};
console.log(person.name); // John
```

### 7. What is the purpose of `typeof` operator in JavaScript?

**Answer:**  
The `typeof` operator is used to determine the type of a variable.

```javascript
Console.Log (typeof 42); // number
Console.Log (typeof 'Hello'); // string
Console.Log (typeof true); // boolean
Console.Log (typeof undefined); // undefined
Console.Log (typeof null); // object
Console.Log (typeof {}); // object
Console.Log (typeof []); // object (arrays are objects)
Console.Log (typeof function (){}); // function
```

### 8. What is NaN in JavaScript?

**Answer:**  
`NaN` stands for Not-a-Number. It is a value representing a computational error.

```javascript
Console.Log (0 / 0); // NaN
Console.Log (Number ('abc')); // NaN
```

### 9. What is the use of `isNaN` function?

**Answer:**  
The `isNaN` function determines whether a value is NaN (Not-a-Number).

```javascript
Console.Log (isNaN (NaN)); // true
Console.Log (isNaN ('abc')); // true
Console.Log (isNaN (123)); // false
```

### 10. What are template literals in JavaScript?

**Answer:**  
Template literals are string literals that allow embedded expressions. They are enclosed by backticks (`` ` ``) instead of quotes.

```javascript
Let name = 'John';
Let message = `Hello, ${name}!`;
Console.Log (message); // Hello, John!
```

### 11. What are conditionals in JavaScript?

**Answer:**  
Conditionals are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. JavaScript supports `if`, `else if`, `else`, and `switch` statements.

```javascript
Let age = 20;
If (age >= 18) {
  Console.Log ('Adult');
} else {
  Console.Log ('Minor');
}
```

### 12. What are loops in JavaScript?

**Answer:**  
Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times. JavaScript supports `for`, `while`, and `do... While` loops.

```javascript
For (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  Console.Log (i);
}
```

### 13. What is the difference between `for` and `for... In` loops?

**Answer:**

- `for` loop is used to iterate over the values in an array or other iterable objects.
- `for... In` loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object.

```javascript
Let array = [10, 20, 30];
For (let i = 0; i < array. Length; i++) {
  Console.Log (array[i]); // 10, 20, 30
}

Let object = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
For (let key in object) {
  Console.Log (key, object[key]); // a 1, b 2, c 3
}
```

### 14. What is a switch statement in JavaScript?

**Answer:**  
The `switch` statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

```javascript
Let fruit = 'apple';
Switch (fruit) {
  Case 'banana':
    Console.Log ('Banana is yellow');
    Break;
  Case 'apple':
    Console.Log ('Apple is red');
    Break;
  Default:
    Console.Log ('Unknown fruit');
}
```

### 15. What is an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE)?

**Answer:**  
An IIFE is a function that runs as soon as it is defined. It is often used to create a private scope to avoid variable hoisting and conflicts.

```javascript
(function () {
  Console.Log ('IIFE executed');
})();
```

### 16. What is the DOM?

**Answer:**  
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

### 17. What is an event in JavaScript?

**Answer:**  
An event is an action or occurrence detected by the browser, such as a mouse click, a key press, or the loading of a web page. Events are used to trigger JavaScript functions to run.

```javascript
document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
  alert('Button clicked!');
});
```

### 18. What is the difference between `window.onload` and `document.ready`?

**Answer:**

- `window.onload` is an event that fires when the entire page, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images, has loaded.
- `document.ready` (often used with libraries like jQuery) fires when the DOM is fully loaded, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and other resources to finish loading.

```javascript
window.onload = function() {
  console.log('Window loaded');
};

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
  console.log('DOM fully loaded and parsed');
});
```

### 19. What are the different types of pop-up boxes available in JavaScript?

**Answer:**  
JavaScript provides three types of pop-up boxes:

- `alert()`: Displays a message with an OK button.
- `confirm()`: Displays a message with OK and Cancel buttons, returning true if OK is pressed and false otherwise.
- `prompt()`: Displays a message with a text input field and OK and Cancel buttons, returning the input value or null if Cancel is pressed.

```javascript
alert('This is an alert box.');
let result = confirm('Do you want to continue?');
let name = prompt('What is your name?');
```

### 20. What are JavaScript data structures?

**Answer:**  
JavaScript provides several built-in data structures:

- **Arrays:** Ordered collections of elements.
- **Objects:** Collections of key-value pairs.
- **Sets:** Collections of unique values.
- **Maps:** Collections of key-value pairs where keys can be any data type.

```javascript
let array = [1, 2, 3];
let object = { name: 'Alice', age: 25 };
let set = new Set([1, 2, 3]);
let map = new Map([['key1', 'value1'], ['key2', 'value2']]);
```

### 21. How do you create an object in JavaScript?

**Answer:**  
Objects can be created using object literals, the `Object` constructor, or the `class` syntax introduced in ES 6.

```javascript
// Object literal
let obj1 = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 25
};

// Object constructor
let obj2 = new Object();
obj2.name = 'Bob';
obj2.age = 30;

// ES6 class syntax
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}
let obj3 = new Person('Charlie', 35);
```

### 22. What is JSON and how is it used?

**Answer:**  
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is used to exchange data between a server and a web application.

```javascript
// JSON string
let jsonString = '{"name": "Alice", "age": 25}';

// Parse JSON string to object
let obj = JSON.parse(jsonString);
console.log(obj.name); // Alice

// Convert object to JSON string
let newJsonString = JSON.stringify(obj);
console.log(newJsonString); // {"name":"Alice","age":25}
```

### 23. What are JavaScript events and how are they handled?

**Answer:**  
JavaScript events are actions that occur in the browser, such as clicks, key presses, or form submissions. Events are handled by assigning event listeners to HTML elements.

```javascript
// Add event listener
document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
  alert('Button clicked!');
});

// Inline event handler
<button onclick="alert('Button clicked!')">Click me</button>
```

### 24. What is the difference between `innerHTML` and `innerText`?

**Answer:**

- `innerHTML` retrieves or sets the HTML content inside an element.
- `innerText` retrieves or sets the text content inside an element, ignoring any HTML tags.

```javascript
let div = document.createElement('div');
div.innerHTML = '<p>Hello, <b>world</b>!</p>';
console.log(div.innerHTML); // <p>Hello, <b>world</b>!</p>
console.log(div.innerText); // Hello, world!
```

### 25. What are callback functions in JavaScript?

**Answer:**  
A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of action or routine.

```javascript
function greet(name, callback) {
  console.log('Hello, ' + name);
  callback();
}

function sayGoodbye() {
  console.log('Goodbye!');
}

greet('Alice', sayGoodbye);
// Output:
// Hello, Alice
// Goodbye!
```

### 26. What is the use of `addEventListener` in JavaScript?

**Answer:**  
`addEventListener` is used to attach an event handler to a specified element. It allows multiple event handlers for the same event and can be removed later with `removeEventListener`.

```javascript
function handleClick() {
  alert('Button clicked!');
}

document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', handleClick);
```

### 27. What is the `this` keyword in JavaScript?

**Answer:**  
The `this` keyword refers to the object that is executing the current function. Its value can change depending on the context in which the function is called.

```javascript
let person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  greet: function() {
    console.log('Hello, ' + this.name);
  }
};

person.greet(); // Hello, Alice
```

### 28. What are prototypes in JavaScript?

**Answer:**  
Prototypes are objects from which other objects inherit properties. Every JavaScript object has a prototype, which is used for inheritance.

```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function() {
  console.log('Hello, ' + this.name);
};

let alice = new Person('Alice');
alice.greet(); // Hello, Alice
```

### 29. What is the difference between `call`, `apply`, and `bind`?

**Answer:**

- `call` invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided individually.
- `apply` invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided as an array.
- `bind` returns a new function, where `this` is bound to the provided value, allowing for partial application of function arguments.

```javascript
function greet(greeting, punctuation) {
  console.log(greeting + ', ' + this.name + punctuation);
}

let person = { name: 'Alice' };

greet.call(person, 'Hello', '!'); // Hello, Alice!
greet.apply(person, ['Hi', '!']); // Hi, Alice!
let boundGreet = greet.bind(person, 'Hey');
boundGreet('!'); // Hey, Alice!
```

### 30. What are JavaScript Promises?

**Answer:**  
Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They represent a value that may be available now, in the future, or never. Promises have three states: `pending`, `fulfilled`, and `rejected`.

```javascript
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve('Success!');
  }, 1000);
});

promise.then((message) => {
  console.log(message); // 'Success!' after 1 second
});
```
